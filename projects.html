                <h3>Campus Orientation - Interactiv Map</h3>
                <p>This project was conducted in collaboration with Linnekåren, who desired a website to help new students locate places on campus. The process included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Conducting interviews to understand the needs and desires of the users.</li>
                    <li>Organizing the information based on the data gathered.</li>
                    <li>Designing and programming an interactive website with clickable markers for detailed information about various locations.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I completed my internship at an IT company where I was involved in an internal project. My role encompassed several key areas, including UI and UX design using Figma to create engaging and functional interfaces. Additionally, I conducted user interviews, administered surveys, and performed tests to refine the application. For programming, I utilized React to develop robust features. As the app approaches its launch date, I remain actively engaged and am now focusing on my thesis in collaboration with the company to further develop and refine the application.

                <p> 
                    This app was developed to help golfers in Småland and Öland effortlessly locate golf courses. With a user-friendly interface and real-time API integration, it provides essential course details and availability. The app's design was informed by feedback from local golfers, ensuring it meets their specific needs effectively.</p>
